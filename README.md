# Yourco Tech Interview

Build a Poll Creator Application using the MERN tech stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

## Background

A customer is in need of the ability to send out Polls to their employees. Your job is to build the API routes and UI to allow a user to create new Polls and to see all past Polls they have created. 

**Note:** There will not be any responses to these Polls. Your main focus is just the creation of the Poll and the viewing of past created Polls.

The Poll Creator should require the user enter a question and the possible options to the question that employees would be able to select at a later time.

**Below is an example of a possible Poll.**

```
What should we have for lunch on Friday?

a) Pizza
b) Salad
c) Sandwiches
```

## Application Structure 

You have been provided with an already created React.js app (app) and Express.js server (server) in pure javascript.

To start the app:

```
cd app
npm run dev
```

To start the server:

```
cd server
npm run dev
```

## Dependencies

The main dependencies needed to accomplish this task are defined in both projects package.json, but please feel free to install and use any other dependencies you want.

## Environment Variables for server

To setup environment variables correctly for the server, please create a .env file in the server folder and add the variable MONGODB_URI="GET_VARIABLE_FROM_INTERVIEWER"

## Internet

It's perfectly fine to use the internet. The use of ChatGPT is also fine as long as it is used solely for technical questions and not for generating your code.
